  <h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
<h2>By Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
</header>
<div class= "verse1">
  <p>
    It was many and many a year ago, 
   In a kingdom by the sea, 
   That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   By the name of Annabel Lee; 
   And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   Than to love and be loved by me. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="verse2">
  <p>
    I was a child and she was a child, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
  But we loved with a love that was more than love— 
   I and my Annabel Lee— 
  With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven 
   Coveted her and me. 
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="verse3">
  <p>
    And this was the reason that, long ago, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
   A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
   My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
   So that her highborn kinsmen came 
   And bore her away from me, 
   To shut her up in a sepulchre 
   In this kingdom by the sea. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="verse4">
  <p>
  The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
  Went envying her and me— 
  Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, 
  In this kingdom by the sea) 
  That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  
  </p>
</div>
<div class="verse5">
<p>
  But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
  Of those who were older than we— 
  Of many far wiser than we— 
  And neither the angels in Heaven above 
  Nor the demons down under the sea 
  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
</p>
</div>
<div class="verse6">
<P>
  For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
  And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
  Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, 
  In her sepulchre there by the sea— 
  In her tomb by the sounding sea.
</P>
</div>
